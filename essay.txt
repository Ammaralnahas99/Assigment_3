1- The event loop continuously checks the event queue for callbacks ready to execute, and pushes them to the call stack when it is empty

2-Libuv is a C library used by Node.js to provide Cross-platform support for threads, timers, and the event loop and to handle the under-the-hood asynchronous operations

3-JS calls async function → registers callback → main thread continues → libuv handles I/O → callback is pushed to event queue → event loop executes it

4-Call Stack:Holds currently executing functions. LIFO structure
Event Queue:Queue of callbacks waiting to be executed when stack is empty
Event Loop:Continuously checks if call stack is empty and moves callbacks from event queue to stack

5-Node.js has a thread pool with default size 4
 gow to change the size :set UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8 

6-Blocking code: Stops the call stack until execution finishes

Non-blocking code: Executes async operations and continues running the main thread, callbacks handled late
